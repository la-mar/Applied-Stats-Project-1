Prior to variable selection:
1. Identify outliers and influential points - maybe exclude them at least temporarily.
2. Add in any transformations of the variables that seem appropriate.




1. Identify the key objectives. 
2. Screen the available variables, deciding on a list that is sensitive to the objectives and excludes obvious redundancies. 3. Perform exploratory analysis, examining graphical displays and correlation coefficients. 
4. Perform transformations as necessary. 
5. Examine a residual plot after fitting a rich model, performing further transformations and considering outliers. 
6. Use a computer-assisted technique for finding a suitable subset of explanatory variables, exerting enough control over the process to be sensitive to the questions of interest. 
7. Proceed with the analysis, using the selected explanatory variables.
