    For our project, we have been asked to assist the Russian bank Sberbank to predict real estate
     prices with more certainty, 
    so they can provide more certainty to their customers and value to their shareholders.  
    The goal of this analysis is to build 2 models for the prediction of Russian real estate property. One model will 
    predict the individual property price given some or all of the variables, and another model to predict the mean
     price of the properties. Both models will use the TRAIN data set to build the model and the PREDICTION 
     data set for the test model.
