% TODO: Add descriptive statistics


\begin{verbatim}
Write a descriptive summary for each of the variables you are working with. It is up to you to decide exactly which strategies you want to use and how you want to present them. At a minimum, you want to do some form of numerical summary and some form of graphical summary for each one. Depending on the nature of your data, these might be a five-number summary, calculation of the mean and standard deviation, a time series chart, a frequency histogram, or any of the various other data summary strategies that we have discussed.
